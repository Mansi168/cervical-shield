## Backstory: Why We Built This Project
In a quiet neighborhood, there resides a woman named Rajni whose journey with cervical cancer became the catalyst for creating CervicalShield. Rajni's experience highlights the importance of awareness and support for cervical health, especially for those who may not have easy access to information or resources.

Rajni's story began with her own battle against cervical cancer. Despite facing numerous challenges, including a lack of education and awareness about the disease, Rajni courageously navigated through her diagnosis and treatment journey. As a non-educated person with limited access to information, Rajni often found herself feeling isolated and ashamed to discuss her condition with others.

Feeling alone and unsure of where to turn, Rajni realized the critical need for a platform that could provide guidance, support, and information about cervical cancer in a way that was accessible and easy to understand. It was from this place of personal struggle and determination that the idea for CervicalShield was born.

Driven by her own experiences and a deep desire to prevent others from feeling the same sense of isolation and shame, Rajni embarked on a mission to create CervicalShield. With the support of healthcare professionals, researchers, and tech experts, she envisioned a web app that would serve as a beacon of hope and support for women facing similar challenges.

Through CervicalShield, Rajni's vision has become a reality. The platform offers a wealth of resources, including personalized risk assessments, educational materials, and a supportive community forum where women can connect and share their experiences openly and without judgment.

Rajni's journey with cervical cancer may have been challenging, but her resilience and determination have paved the way for CervicalShield to make a meaningful impact in the lives of women everywhere. Her story serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of awareness, support, and empowerment in the fight against cervical cancer.
